It's a very tasty - sour/salty flavor. \"Sumac seeds\" would be delicious on this dish!

Turn off the heat. Drizzle olive oil and toss until coated. Add a good, fine sea salt and Sumac to taste. Toss well, cool on paper towels and store in mason jars in the fridge.

Didn’t have sumac, so as suggested, tried a teaspoon each of smoked paprika and za’atar, plus another squeeze of lemon. Felt sauce could use more depth, so will probably hunt down sumac. (Can you go wrong with butter, tho?). I used 50/50 butter and ghee, and everything toasted up nicely. Served with pearl barley and broccoli. Broccoli tossed with olive oil and salt, and baked on the same pan with fish. Put broccoli on the parchment in the pre-heating oven, and while fish cooked. It got lightly charred in the heating/hot oven, which grounded the acidity of the lemon in the sauce IMHO. (Very well received as company-worthy)","datePublished":"2025-03-15T01:07:34.000Z"},{"@type":"Review","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rob"},"reviewBody":"This recipe would be just as tasty with another species of fish, eg halibut.

                  <p>This easy baked cod takes your weeknight cooking to wonderful heights, in just 15 minutes. While
                    the fish bakes, you’ll make a browned-butter topping that offers richness and crunch from the pine
                    nuts, as well as a welcome acidity thanks to the sumac and lemon juice. Serve this with some lightly
                    steamed greens or boiled new potatoes for a complete meal.</p>
