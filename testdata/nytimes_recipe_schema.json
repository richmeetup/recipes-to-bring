Didn’t have sumac, so as suggested, tried a teaspoon each of smoked paprika and za’atar, plus another squeeze of lemon. Felt sauce could use more depth, so will probably hunt down sumac. (Can you go wrong with butter, tho?). I used 50/50 butter and ghee, and everything toasted up nicely. Served with pearl barley and broccoli. Broccoli tossed with olive oil and salt, and baked on the same pan with fish. Put broccoli on the parchment in the pre-heating oven, and while fish cooked. It got lightly charred in the heating/hot oven, which grounded the acidity of the lemon in the sauce IMHO. (Very well received as company-worthy)",
